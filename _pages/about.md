My name is Ehsan (pronounced /eh☀️/ or /ih☀️/, or even /e☀️/).
I am a Research Scientist in the Conversational Assistant team at [ServiceNow Resaerch](https://www.servicenow.com/research/).

I am broadly interested in building intelligent autonomous systems that are capable of complex reasoning ("[TapeAgents framework](https://github.com/ServiceNow/TapeAgents/)").
My research focused on robust evaluation ("[QA evaluation](https://aclanthology.org/2023.acl-long.307/)" at ACL'23 and SIGIR'24, "[NoMIRACL](https://aclanthology.org/2024.findings-emnlp.730/)" at EMNLP'24, "[Touché-2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07790)" at SIGIR'24 and "[MIRACL](http://miracl.ai/)" at TACL'23) 
and data-efficient training methods for distilling a small model from large models ("[kNN-KD](https://aclanthology.org/2021.findings-acl.309/)" at ACL'21 and ACL'22) and training language models.

Prior to this, I was a Post-doctoral Fellow at the David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science, University of Waterloo, hosted by [Jimmy Lin](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~jimmylin/).
I completed my PhD at the University of Alberta, advised by [Davood Rafiei](https://cs.ualberta.ca/~drafiei/).
I was also fortunate enough to collaborate with [Charles Clarke](https://plg.uwaterloo.ca/~claclark/) and [Siva Reddy](https://sivareddy.in/).
I also interned as a researcher at Huawei Noah's Ark Lab in Montreal and worked with [Mehdi Rezagholizadeh](https://ca.linkedin.com/in/mehdi-rezagholizadeh-61212346).
Before PhD, I was working as a software engineer.
