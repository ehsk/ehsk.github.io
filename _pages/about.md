My name is Ehsan (pronounced /eh☀️/ or /ih☀️/, or even /e☀️/).
I am a Research Scientist in the Conversational Assistant team at [ServiceNow Resaerch](https://www.servicenow.com/research/).

I am broadly interested in the intersection of natural language processing and information retrieval.
My goal is to facilitate information access over massive unstructured materials via:
- Building scalable and robust retrieval systems that are suitable for deployment "in the wild",
- Data-centric strategies to systematically improve data quality and to overcome bias in data.

Prior to this, I was a Post-doctoral Fellow at the David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science, University of Waterloo, hosted by [Jimmy Lin](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~jimmylin/).
I completed my PhD at the University of Alberta, advised by [Davood Rafiei](https://cs.ualberta.ca/~drafiei/).
I was also fortunate enough to collaborate with [Charles Clarke](https://plg.uwaterloo.ca/~claclark/) and [Siva Reddy](https://sivareddy.in/).
I also interned as a researcher at Huawei Noah's Ark Lab in Montreal and worked with [Mehdi Rezagholizadeh](https://ca.linkedin.com/in/mehdi-rezagholizadeh-61212346).
Before PhD, I was working as a software engineer.
